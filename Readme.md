# Automating CI CD with Jenkins on Google Cloud

This is a sample demo showcasing how to perform CI/CD integration using Jenkins. It covers the comprehensive process of setting up DevOps tools on Google Cloud, integrating Jenkins with Tomcat for automated deployments, and performing Git workflow operations.

I'm excited to share these steps with the community to help others understand how to build a complete CI/CD pipeline in the cloud.

##  Infrastructure Overview

To accomplish this task, I created **4 Virtual Machines** (VMs) in Google Cloud:

| VM        | Purpose                                                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| platform  | Acts like a developer machine for handling production code     |
| jenkins   | Hosts Jenkins for CI/CD automation                             |
| tomcat-1  | Tomcat server for internal deployment and testing              |
| tomcat-2  | Another Tomcat server for internal sharing and redundancy      |

## CI/CD Pipeline Steps

###   Step 1: Clone GitHub Repository to Platform VM
I have cloned my project repository to the platform VM, simulating a developer pushing code changes.

---

###   Step 2: Configure Jenkins VM
- Installed Jenkins
- Set up Java, Git, and required dependencies
- Installed necessary Jenkins plugins (e.g., Git, Deploy to Container, etc.)  

This guide outlines the steps i followed  to install Java 17, Apache Maven, on Ubuntu system. The same steps should be followed for both Jenkins and Tomcat machines.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre
sudo apt install vim wget git -y
```

```
# Download and install Apache Maven
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.8/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.8-bin.tar.gz
tar xvf apache-maven-3.9.8-bin.tar.gz
sudo mv apache-maven-3.9.8 /usr/local/apache-maven
```

```
# Configure Environment Variables  
vim ~/.profile
```

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven
export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
export PATH=$M2:$PATH
```

```
sudo vim /etc/environment
```

```
# add:
:/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/bin:/usr/local/apache-maven/bin"
```

```
`source ~/.profile
```


```
# Verify
mvn -version
java --version
```

# Download and install Apache Maven 
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.8/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.8-bin.tar.gz
tar xvf apache-maven-3.9.8-bin.tar.gz
sudo mv apache-maven-3.9.8 /usr/local/apache-maven

#  Configure Jenkins VM  
- Installed Jenkins
- Set up Java, Git, and required dependencies
- Installed necessary Jenkins plugins (e.g., Git, Deploy to Container, etc.)

#  Configure Tomcat VMs  
- Installed and configured Apache Tomcat
- Enabled `manager-script` role for remote deployments
- Verified accessibility of `/manager/text` endpoint

## ðŸ“š  What I Learned

- **Jenkins Setup on GCP**: Learned how to install and configure Jenkins in a VM environment with necessary tools and variables.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Creation**: Built pipelines to automate deployment from Jenkins to Tomcat.
- **Git Mastery**: Practiced advanced Git commands for branching, merging, and managing development workflows.
- **Understanding SDLC**: Gained insights into managing and automating the software development lifecycle, from code push to production deployment.
